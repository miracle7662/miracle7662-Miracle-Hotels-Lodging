Subject: Malformed JSON Response from States API

Hi Team,

I've encountered an issue with the API endpoint `http://localhost:3001/api/states`. The response is malformed and does not return valid JSON. This is causing the state dropdown in the DistrictMaster component to not display the state names correctly.

The current response structure is missing commas between key-value pairs, which results in an invalid JSON format. Please review and correct the API response to ensure it returns properly formatted JSON.

Thank you!

Best,
[Your Name]
